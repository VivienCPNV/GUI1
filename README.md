# Rough idea
A simple dashboard for the administration of bot accounts from different websites (discord, telegram, steam and others)
This dashboard would allow to create, configure, reboot, take offline, view activity history and various other features.
## Quick list of possible features
Here is a quick list of the possible features available for this dashboard
- List all bots
	- Filter all the bots
- Create bots from the dashboard
- Configure bots from the dashboard
- Change status
	- Online
	- Offline
	- Reboot
- Stats regarding the bots (uptime, ressource consumption, etc.)
- View logs
- Modular approach provida an API for adding your own bot type

# Competition
We can see that most of all the dashbaords have few points in common that would be worth
re-implementing such as a side panel for easy navigation. Some of them also use popups for 
configuring some parts. It would be ideal to implement that for example when creating a new bot,
a dialog box whould pop-up and ask the needed info rather then needing to move to another panel.
